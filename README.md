![Design preview for the Blog preview card coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Hi! ðŸ‘‹

This is my second Frontend Mentor Coding Challenge.

It is a good challenge to practice my HTML and CSS skills. Using display:flex made easy to handle the content within the card and with a specified gap between gap.With width property the card is responisve.

Creating a Blog Preview card using HTML and CSS was fun and engaing.

Thank you Frontend Mentor.
